## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React 19 (ESM), Tailwind CSS
-   **Icons**: FontAwesome 6, Material Symbols
-   **AI Core**: `@google/genai` (Google Generative AI SDK)
-   **Audio**: Web Audio API (ScriptProcessor & AudioBufferSource)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   A Google AI Studio API Key.
-   For Video generation, a paid GCP project is required via the selection dialog.

### Environment Configuration
The application expects the following environment variable to be available:
```javascript
process.env.API_KEY // Your Gemini API Key
```

## 📐 Architecture

The app is built with a modular architecture:
-   `GeminiService`: A centralized wrapper for all AI interactions.
-   `AIView`: Enum-based state management for switching between workspace modules.
-   `MonitoringPanel`: A real-time log of API operations, status codes, and latency tracking.

## 🛡️ Security & Performance
-   **Privacy-First**: No personal data is stored; all AI interactions happen directly through the SDK.
-   **Optimized Rendering**: Lazy-loaded modules and CSS-based animations for a smooth 60FPS UI.
-   **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and graceful degradation for API limitations.
